            <h4><strong>"What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?"</strong></h4>

            <p>
                I honestly can't say I've learned anything "new" about myself and my ego as such, a lot of the subjects that have come up I have come across in my life at one point or another through my own personal interest in subjects like self improvement, I am certainly getting a better understanding of myself and have had a few things put into perspective. As having all these subjects put together in a curriculum gives me a good framework to better put those subjects into practice, particularly in a work and careers context.
            </p>

            <h4><strong>"What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?"</strong></h4>

            <p>
                As far as values are concerned I would say it comes down to a matter of your drive and reasons for getting into web development / programming.
            </p>

            <p>
                Empathy and self awareness really go hand in hand in my opinion, empathy is at the end of the day understanding someones position and feelings, being able to relate to them, this is an important thing to have when you work with others (which you most certainly will when working in the tech industry), and it allows you to better relate to your peers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Being aware of yourself, your limitations, your flaws, and understanding that you don't need to be perfect to do good work and to excel is an important thing to be able to do especially in such a fast moving industry. Being self aware also allows you to keep tabs on yourself being aware when your emotions and or your ego are ever getting the better of you it let's you pay attention to it and manage it in a healthy and constructive manner.
            </p>

            <h4><strong>"What has surprised you the most about the core learning?"</strong></h4>

            <p>
                I suppose, though it might be kind of silly to say, I wouldn't have associated the kind of subjects covered in the core sections as being so paramount to getting hired in this industry though once it's pointed out it is quite obvious that employers and businesses would put a great deal of priority into core skills like emotional intelligence and a growth mindset, those subjects around the topic of self improvement are things that I have taken a prior passing interest in personally, but I guess I just never thought of those things in that sort of context.
            </p>

            <h4><strong>"What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?"</strong></h4>

            <p>
                For me, simply putting it into practice, that might be kind of a cheap answer but it is the most honest one I can give, learning about these subjects is quite easy but the application of it is another topic entirely, I'm not the most sociable person there is and I am certainly quite the introvert by nature and though I can be somewhat sociable when the time calls for it, I've still got a long way to go in that regard.
            </p>

            <h4><strong>"why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?"</strong></h4>

            <p>
                Well quite simply put, it's about giving people not just the technical skills they need to work in the inudustry, but to also give them the skills to better connect with their peers and employers, which is a benefit in and of itself, but which will also ultimately give the students much greater future opportunities in the industry moving forward.
            </p>

            <h4><strong>"Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time for practicing programming instead? Justify your answer"</strong></h4>

            <p>
                Having previously been enrolled in a bachelors course where most of the things I had to do didn't provide much, if any, value to my education or my personal growth, I know what it's like to have my time wasted on things that didn't amount to anything, and I can say without a doubt that the core content in the course has not been a waste of time at all, ultimately what has been made repeatedly clear through this course is that it's focused on giving you the skills you need to not only go into the industry but to also thrive in it, which I personally appreciate, and if you really want to thrive not only in this industry but any industry for that matter, you need to be able to cultivate good relationships with your peers which is in my opinion the entire point of the core skills sections of the curriculum.
