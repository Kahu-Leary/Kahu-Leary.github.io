            <h4><strong>"What is Neuroplasticity and a Growth Mindset"</strong></h4>

            <p>
                First it's important to define what these two topics are, simply put Neuroplasticity is your minds ability to adapt, to evolve/change in regards to the various demands of it's circumstances.
            </p>

            <p>
                A Growth mindset essentially is all about a person having a positive outlook on what they can accomplish and learn, knowing that if they just put the time and effort in they can learn to become great at any skill, no matter your default abilities and talents.
            </p>

            <p> 
                The complete opposite to a growth mindset is a fixed mindset, people with a fixed mindset think that they either have an innate inborn ability to do something or they don't and that they have no control over it.
            </p>

            <h4><strong>"My understanding of the benefits of Neuroplasticity and a Growth mindset"</strong></h4>

            <p>
                Your mind is not a static thing, it is ever changing, Neuroplasticity is your minds ability to adapt to the demands that are placed on it, just like muscles that get worked hard at the gym and develop greater strength it improves at various skills the more time and effort are placed on said skills.
            </p>

            <p>
                That being said Neuroplasticity is also something that can diminish over time if not being utilized, again just like a muscle, if you don't use it you lose it. Many people believe that the reason children seem to learn so fast is because they are in a higher state of Neuroplasticity not necessarily because they're younger but because they are in a constant state of learning, learning about every single thing in the world around them, all of it being new and exciting to them.
            </p>

            <p>
                And that the reason many peoples minds deteriorate as they get older is greatly to do with the fact we often aren't learning as much as we get older hence our brains become less "primed"
            </p>

            <p>
                Having a growth mindset is all about understanding this principle of the brain not being static, that it can change and appling it to yourself, understanding that sure some people may have more of a "knack" for a certain skill than maybe you do, they may be naturally better at maths or some other skill than you, but if you're willing to put in the time and effort to learn you can also become great at your chosen skill, no matter your starting point.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ultimately your ability is a measurment of how much effort you put into something not what you are or are not born with, if you go into your undertakings with a mindset of I can become great at any skill if I really want to and just put the time and effort in, you can "become" the kind of person who is good at said skills.
            </p>

            <p>
                Obviously these two subjects are very tightly interwoven with each other and having a growth mindset allows us to fully utilize the minds maleable nature and opens a world of possiblities for ourselfs and our goals in life.
            </p>
