            <h4><strong>"Getting blocked on a simple problem"</strong></h4>

            <p>
                For me the biggest road block I hit was during one of the Katas, "Manipulating JS Objects" where one of the tests stated,
            </p>

            <p>
                "The value of the terah children property should be defined as an Object" 
            </p>

            <p> 
                now for some this may have seemed extremely easy and I knew it must be something super simple but I just couldn't get my head around it, I tried Googling for how to declare a property as an Object and funnily enough I was getting all these complicated answers that I thought seemed way to overcomplicated and what seemed like the simplest answer I could find was to use the "defineProperty()" method though no matter what I tried I just couldn't get it to work. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Eventually I asked one of my cohorts about that particular test and sure enough, the answer was indeed very simple, rather than trying to use a method to assign a property to an Object and trying to declare that it was another Object, I just had to declare an Object like you would any other, but use the accessor using dot notation as a name for said Object "terah.children" and just like that it passed.
            </p>

            <p>
                My two take away lessons from that experience is sometimes the simpliest and most fundamental answers can be the hardest to find, and sometimes all you need is a second pair of eyes and a different perspective to get things working.
            </p>

            <h4><strong>"Solved a problem in an elegant way"</strong></h4>

            <p>
                In all honesty, I don't think I'm anywhere near the level yet where I can fairly determine whether any of my solutions are "elegant" as of yet, since I'm still quite inexperienced in terms of my coding ability, I can at least say that I solved them, which is the most important thing in my book.
            </p>

            <!-- <p>
                That being said I think
            </p> -->

            <h4><strong>"Psuedocode"</strong></h4>

            <p>
                Pseudocode is not my strongest skill and definitely needs a lot more practice for me to get better at it, but it is certainly a good idea that helps quite a bit just like talking a problem through to someone else is very useful and I will keep trying to implement it as I progress for sure.
            </p>

            <h4><strong>"Trying something"</strong></h4>

            <p>
                Most of the time this rarely works for me honestly, but I give it a shot all the same now and again, no doubt as my skills improve the success rate with this will improve as time goes on.
            </p>

            <h4><strong>"Rubber ducky method"</strong></h4>

            <p>
                The rubber ducky method is certainly something I try and do all the time when I'm working at home either with my cat or with a miniature owl (instead of a duck) I keep at my desk at home, it makes a big difference saying things out loud even if you may not think so, it certainly made a few things a lot more straight forward once I did it.
            </p>

            <h4><strong>"Reading error messages"</strong></h4>

            <p>
                I find reading the error message can sometimes be a little obscure and confusing in some cases but slowing down, reading and giving it some thought can make a big differnence and if it's too obscure and confusing using Google to learn more about it is always helpful in my experience limited as it might be.
            </p>

            <h4><strong>"Console.logging"</strong></h4>

            <p>
                Console.log is really useful and is often helpful at getting my bearings on how I've applied my code. I'd say I'm quite confident with console.log.
            </p>

            <h4><strong>"Googling"</strong></h4>

            <p>
                Google is my best friend and has already saved me a lot of trouble on various problems, I find the key to using Google successfully is if you're not finding anything useful is to try and rephrase the question in a different way, finding the right answers on Google is a skill in it's own right
            </p>

            <h4><strong>"Asking your peers for help"</strong></h4>

            <p>
                Out of everything listed here this is one of the most useful things to do simply getting a second pair of eyes and a different perspective on a problem helps immensely for me. Even if I can be a bit stubborn at trying to figure it out by myself.
            </p>

            <h4><strong>"Asking your coaches for help"</strong></h4>

            <p>
                So far I've not gotten stuck to the point where I've needed to ask any of the coaches for help not yet that is.
            </p>

            <h4><strong>"Improving your process with reflection"</strong></h4>

            <p>
                I find having to break down and explain a concept wether it be in person or in writing is the best way  to keep tabs on yourself and make sure you really understand what you've learned, I've personally always found that there is a big differnce between "knowing" something and "understanding" something and reflections certainly serve me well in that regard.
