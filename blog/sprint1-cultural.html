            <p>For the past 7 years my life has revolved around latin dance, it is undoubtedly a great passion of mine and I have dedicated that time to learning and living as much of it as possible, even within the first year of starting dance I moved to Australia just so I could learn from many of my idols in the latin dance industry, through it I've met many people from many different backgrounds, some have come and gone, others have become the best lifelong friends anyone could ever ask for.</p>

            <p>It's lead to many of the most unforgetable experiences of my life, both good and bad, and it is an integral part of my identity, through dance and these facets of it, I've learned a lot about myself, and what I've come to value.</p>

            <p>What I value the most? Of course just like any other person I have a lot of things I value but the first that come to my mind and that I prioritize when I get that question, my friends and my family, people who work hard and go the distance for whats important to them, honouring ones word and promises, animals, nature, and kindness.</p>

            <h4><strong>How I see myself?</strong></h4>

            <p>I am certainly the quiet type that's for sure and while I don't generally say much I am always having some kind of conversation in my head, whether it be purely simple day dreaming or having a philosophical debate with myself, I tend to get lost in my own thoughts quite often.</p>

            <p>I'm prone to strong bouts of perfectionism and can be quite stubborn at getting something to a point that I would deem it "good enough".</p>

            <p>I have a strong sense of responsiblilty about staying true to my word, whether it be helping someone I know move house or promising I'll attend a friends special event, I take my commitments to others very serously.</p>

            <p>In a more general sense, I would view myself as a very go with the flow kind of guy.</p>

            <h4><strong>How others see me?</strong></h4>

            <p>Talking to my parents and friends how they see me, a lot of the opinions are pretty much the same as what I say about myself, perfectionist, often lost in thought, very committed to my word once I give it... etc.</p>

            <p>And in a general sense as one of my friends put it "Cool as a cucumber" and that I might appear a little stand offish but I'm actually quite friendly once someone actually approaches me.</p>

            <h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>

            <p>While writing, researching and thinking about this section I also took the myers briggs 16 personalities test, my personality type being (Logician) there is a lot in it so I will just leave a link for it here <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality">(https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality)</a> should it need to be read, and hopefully this can also give more clarity about who I am as person, and that what I've written and tried to convey has at least given some insight into my identity, values and strengths.</p>
