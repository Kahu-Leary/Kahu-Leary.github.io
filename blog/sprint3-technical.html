            <h4><strong>"An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS"</strong></h4>

            <p>My favourite analogy to describe them is a house, HTML is the foundation and frame of the house, it's
                structure and CSS is the decorations of that house such as the paint/wallpaper, the curtains, and
                everything to do with how the house looks or is presented.
            </p>

            <h4><strong>"Control flow and Loops"</strong></h4>

            <p>Control flow is all about giving decision making to your programs, a flowchart that your program can
                follow when it encounters a choice, for example an analogy to describe it, let's say you are baking a
                cake and following a recipe, the recipe gives you alternatives to every ingredient, let's say the recipe
                requires eggs, you go to collect the eggs but see you have run out without realizing it. Now you have a
                choice to make "Go to the supermarket and get more eggs" or "Use alternative given in recipe" now what
                choice you make depends on other factors, for example "do you have time to get the eggs and come back?",
                "Is the supermarket closed and not even an option right now?". So you evaluate these conditions let's
                say teh supermarket is closed so you go for the option that follows the condition "Supermarket is
                closed" the choice that follows that "Use alternative given in recipe" is what you evaluate to be the
                right choice to make.

                With a control flow you are applying that same decision proccess to your program, e.g "if this is true
                then do this (option A), if not then do something else (option B)".

                As for loops, loops are simply a set of instructions to repeat or "loop" something until it is no longer
                needed, following along with our cake analogy lets say the recipe requires "6 cups of flour" so you
                scoop the flour and add it to the bowl of cake mix, but that's only one cup, so you repeat the action
                again "scoop the flour" and "add to cake mix" but still that's only two cups so you repeat the proccess
                again and as many times as you need until the cake mix has "6 cups of flour" at which point you stop
                repeating the action.

                When you write a loop you are telling your program to repeat something as many times as needed until a
                certain condition has been met.</p>

            <h4><strong>"What is the DOM"</strong></h4>

            <p>The DOM (Document Object Model) is to quote Wikipedia a "Cross-platform and language-independent
                interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object
                representing a part of the document." to put it as simply as possible it is a modeled representation of
                a webpage that a programming language can use to understand a webpage and all it's respective parts,
                where they are, and allows it to manipulate and control said webpage.</p>

            <p>On their own programming languages don't understand what a webpage really is, so if you were using for
                example Javascript and you want it to change the color of an element on a webpage, say the title of the
                page to the color red, you need a way of telling Javascript what and where that title is, and how to
                manipulate it, that's what the DOM is, a representation of the webpage or a translation inbetween the
                page and programming language being used so that the programming language (in this case Javascript)
                would understand how and what to do.</p>

            <h4><strong>"The difference between accessing data from arrays as opposed to objects"</strong></h4>

            <p>First what is an array? How would you use the term array in an everyday context? Well the best example I
                found works for me would be in the context of a car dealership saying "We have cars in a wide array of
                colors", e.g car 1 is red, car 2 is blue, so when you think of an array just think of it as a
                "collection" of some kind, in the abstract case of programming a collection of data. To access data in
                an array you use the number associated with it using the index of the array (counting through the index
                always starts at the number zero) e.g item[0], item[1], item[2]... etc, just like if those items were
                lined up next to each other in real life and to access those specific values you say the numbered
                position of the item in the line up, so say you want the green car in the line up which is in index
                position 3 using what you would refer to as bracket notation you place the index number into square
                brackets to say what car you want,in this case number 3 it would look like this cars[3].</p>

            <p>So finally writing that out in a programming context var myCarPurchase = cars[3]; now the
                "myCarsPurchase" variable contains the value of "green car"</p>

            <p>Moving on to objects and what they are, to quote Wikipedia "In computer science, an object can be a
                variable, a data structure, a function, or a method, and as such, is a value in memory referenced by an
                identifier. In the class-based and object-oriented programming paradigms, object refers to a particular
                instance of a class, where the object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures.
                In the relational model of database management, an object can be a table or column, or an association
                between data and a database entity (such as relating a person's age to a specific person)."</p>

            <p>So using an object as a collection of data like with the array example, in order for us to access data in
                an object you don't pass an index position like you do with the array, you would use the key associated
                with the value you are after, so let's say we have an object called carDealerShip we want to select the
                green car which happens to be a Toyota inside it, so rather than getting it via the index number we
                refer to it by name in this case, which is Toyota, so carDealerShip['Toyota'] would get you the green
                car. You can also use what's called dot notation which is simply a . directly followed by the key e.g
                carDealerShip.Toyota, would get you the same result.</p>

            <p>Examples</p>

            <p>var myCarPurchase = carDealerShip['Toyota']</p>
            <p>or</p>
            <p>var myCarPurchase = carDealerShip.Toyota</p>

            <h4><strong>"What are functions and why are they useful"</strong></h4>

            <p>Functions are organised blocks of code that as the name suggests add functionality to your program. For
                example like buttons on a tv remote, if you don't have a button on the remote to change the channel then
                obviously you wouldn't be able to, by creating functions you can then "call" or "activate" these
                functions from other parts of the code, and just like buttons on a tv remote you can repeatedly use
                these functions as many times as you want e.g change the channel as many times as you want/need... etc.
            </p>
