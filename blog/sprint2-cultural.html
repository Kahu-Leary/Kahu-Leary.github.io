            <h4><strong> # Your Blog</strong></h4>
            <h4><strong>Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms?</strong></h4>

            <p>Set up the blog page on my personal website, starting with a template.
                Added the main.css file to stylize the pages of the website.
                Added a link to the main.css file to make the pages use the styling.</p>

            <h4><strong>How are you finding working with the timeboxes?</strong></h4>

            <p>It's definitley a good habit to have, I'm still getting used to timeboxing and for some things it's easy to stick to and I have successfully for those things, but in the case of others, writing out my
            reflections and designing my website it's very easy for me to over do the perfectionism.</p>

            <h4><strong> # Learn HTML and CSS</strong></h4>
            <h4><strong>What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?</strong></h4>

            <p>There wasn't anything extravagant in regards to obstacles other than the occasional hiccup through the Udacity course work e.g the occasonal broken link, the biggest personal issue I had was just brieflydrawing a blank when going to write a specific line of code for something, which a 1 second Google search quickly fixed.</p>

            <h4><strong>What are you proud of from this challenge?</strong></h4>
            
            <p>Since I've dabbled with HTML and CSS before this particular challenge was more a revision of what I've touched on prior to now, I wouldn't say I had a thing that I was proud of specifically for this challenge but that being said, I'm proud I actually remember most of the details relating to HTML and CSS.</p>

            <h4><strong> # Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge</strong></h4>
            <h4><strong>Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.</strong></h4>

            <p>HTML is a markup language made with the purpose of formating and sharing information via web browsers, the letters HTML is an acronym that stands for "Hyper Text Markup Language". CSS is a styling language and is also an acronym that stands for "Cascading Style Sheets" which is used to describe the presentation of an HTML document, the purpose of CSS being to seperate the content (HTML) from the presentation of that content e.g the colours, fonts, spacing and so on.</p>

            <h4><strong>Any moments of surprise or joy? </strong></h4>

            <p>Honestly any time something doesn't seem to work the way it's supposed to and I manage to figure it out is really fun.</p>

            <h4><strong>If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?</strong></h4>

            <p>If I had to describe HTML and CSS as animals. HTML being all about the structure of a website, I would describe it as a Beaver which spends it's time building their dam, giving it structure to serve it'spurpose. CSS being about the style/appearance of the website, I would describe it as a Peacock it's elaborate and stylized feathers while beautiful are quite impractical from a survival standpoint and don't serve much use in the way of self preservation but are extremely useful in attracting a mate, much like CSS being used to attract visitors through visual appeal.</p>

<!-- Hey everyone, just introducing myself proper, a little late to the party :sweat_smile:.
My name is Kahu Leary,
I'm currently living in Auckland, where I was born and raised.
In regards to values and identity.
I've always had great respect for people who would always work hard/try their best
in the things they choose to pursue regardless of whatever their skill level, ability or outcomes,
the kind of people who go the extra mile for the things that matter to them, and while I don't consider myself
the smartest, the most talented or the most organised etc.
I've always tried the best I can to emulate that sort of characteristic in my own pursuits wherever possible.
As for why I'm attending Dev Academy, I've had an interest in web developement for quite a while now
and previously did other courses that always promised giving me the skills I needed to persue a career in
that industry but would always end up having a really strong biased towards something else e.g graphic design, making
video games, and would just keep me really busy with those subjects, while barely touching on web developement.
Having just been in this course for a few days I can already tell that Dev Academy's focus on full stack web and
learning real hands on skills rather than dry theory is exactly what I've been looking for, and regardless of each
person having slightly varied reasons for starting everyone seems to share the same collective enthusiasm for starting a
career in this industry, which is encouraging to see.
I look forward to meeting you all in person as the course progresses :) -->
