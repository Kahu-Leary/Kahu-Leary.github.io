            <h4><strong>"What is your long term goal and or career pathway?"</strong></h4>

            <p>My long term goal is to become a full stack web developer first for a company but eventually for myself as a freelancer, so I can travel freely while earning a good income for myself, and to be able to take care of my parents as they get older.</p>

            <h4><strong>"What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?"</strong></h4>

            <p>I would like to greatly improve my networking and rapport building skills, as I'm quite the introvert by nature.</p>

            <h4><strong>"A description of your own strengths and limitations"</strong></h4>

            <p>How I would describe my strengths and limitations, in terms of strengths, I would say I had a decent eye for design and the visual, I am a very open minded person and am always open to hearing knew ideas from anyone else, and when something inspires me (granted that's not always the easiest thing to do :D ) I can be an excellent achiever and hard worker.</p>

            <p>In terms of limitations I'm not great at maths and the more analytical side of things, I'm a very quiet and introverted person which isn't always a bad thing, but as a result I'm not great at conversation particularly when I'm first getting to know people, though I will say I get better the more I get to know them.</p>

            <h4><strong>"Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives."</strong></h4>
            
            <p>I really enjoy learning any skill in a group setting and always enjoy the strong feeling of camaraderie that comes with it.</p>

            <p>When it comes to managing myself and working productively, I will make sure to always do my best to keep open and clear communication with my peers and facilitators, and stick to any agreed schedule with my cohorts as we work in teams, while doing my best to be friendly and encouraging to those I work with.</p>

            <h4><strong>"A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way."</strong></h4>

            <p>I am fully committed to gaining the skills I need to start a career in web development and if I should get stuck on anything and not be able to figure it out via online resources like Google, Stack Overflow... etc or through the help/advice of my fellow cohorts, I will promptly seek the advice of my faclitators on how to sort out the problem.</p>

            <h4><strong>"A description of what you expect from the facilitation team"</strong></h4>

            <p>I want to learn as much of the skills that I need to start building a career in the web development industry, based on what I've seen from the facilitators so far I would expect them to be very friendly and helpful and do everything they can to help me out in acheiving that goal, and give me open and honest feedback on my work and how to improve it.</p>

            <h4><strong> # Your Blog</strong></h4>
            <h4><strong>Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms?</strong></h4>

            <p>Set up the blog page on my personal website, starting with a template.
                Added the main.css file to stylize the pages of the website.
                Added a link to the main.css file to make the pages use the styling.</p>

            <h4><strong>How are you finding working with the timeboxes?</strong></h4>

            <p>It's definitley a good habit to have, I'm still getting used to timeboxing and for some things it's easy to stick to and I have successfully for those things, but in the case of others, writing out my
            reflections and designing my website it's very easy for me to over do the perfectionism.</p>

            <h4><strong> # Learn HTML and CSS</strong></h4>
            <h4><strong>What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?</strong></h4>

            <p>There wasn't anything extravagant in regards to obstacles other than the occasional hiccup through the Udacity course work e.g the occasonal broken link, the biggest personal issue I had was just brieflydrawing a blank when going to write a specific line of code for something, which a 1 second Google search quickly fixed.</p>

            <h4><strong>What are you proud of from this challenge?</strong></h4>
            
            <p>Since I've dabbled with HTML and CSS before this particular challenge was more a revision of what I've touched on prior to now, I wouldn't say I had a thing that I was proud of specifically for this challenge but that being said, I'm proud I actually remember most of the details relating to HTML and CSS.</p>

            <h4><strong> # Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge</strong></h4>
            <h4><strong>Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.</strong></h4>

            <p>HTML is a markup language made with the purpose of formating and sharing information via web browsers, the letters HTML is an acronym that stands for "Hyper Text Markup Language". CSS is a styling language and is also an acronym that stands for "Cascading Style Sheets" which is used to describe the presentation of an HTML document, the purpose of CSS being to seperate the content (HTML) from the presentation of that content e.g the colours, fonts, spacing and so on.</p>

            <h4><strong>Any moments of surprise or joy? </strong></h4>

            <p>Honestly any time something doesn't seem to work the way it's supposed to and I manage to figure it out is really fun.</p>

            <h4><strong>If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?</strong></h4>

            <p>If I had to describe HTML and CSS as animals. HTML being all about the structure of a website, I would describe it as a Beaver which spends it's time building their dam, giving it structure to serve it'spurpose. CSS being about the style/appearance of the website, I would describe it as a Peacock it's elaborate and stylized feathers while beautiful are quite impractical from a survival standpoint and don't serve much use in the way of self preservation but are extremely useful in attracting a mate, much like CSS being used to attract visitors through visual appeal.</p>
